        <p>
            Would you like to visit the U.S. for business or recreational purposes?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            This program is for people who are not from visa-exempt countries and want to enter the United States temporarily for business (B-1), for tourism (B-2), or for a combination of both purposes (B-1/B-2).
        </p>
        <p>
            Citizens of visa-exempt countries can travel to the U.S. without a visa but may still need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), which is different from a Visitor Visa.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recommend starting the application process as early as possible, as travel restrictions and lengthy consulate wait times for visa appointments may impact your travel plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check your eligibility now!

            <h3>
                Eligibility Confirmation Before Payment</h3>
            <p>First you will answer a few questions to ensure you are eligible for the visa. Only if you are eligible will the payment unlock. Making payment assigns an immigration lawyer or regulated consultant to your application. We are transparent in our process and pricing, and clearly list all the fees and processing times for your visa. Read our Transparency Pledge. We use Stripe for credit or debit card payment processing, which is secure and encrypted.</p>
